            With over three years of experience in software and web development, I have successfully led the design, development, and deployment of numerous web applications, ensuring exceptional performance, scalability, and user experiences across a variety of projects. My technical expertise spans a wide array of tools and technologies, including Java, Spring Boot, Python, and database management systems such as MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I am proficient in both front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Angular, as well as back-end solutions involving RESTful APIs, Spring Boot, and Hibernate. Additionally, I have extensive experience with cloud computing platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) and implementing DevOps practices using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins. Dedicated to staying at the forefront of industry trends, I actively enhance my skills through online courses, certifications, and podcasts, particularly in areas like cloud computing, DevOps tools, big data technologies (Hadoop, Spark), and backend frameworks (Spring Boot, Django).
